Formulas

molar mass = (%abundance of isotope 1)/100*mass of isotope 1 + (%abundance of isotope 2)/100*mass of isotope 2

diamond density = (Carbons per unit cell * molar mass)/(Avogadro's number * (diamond lattice constant)3)

V= (4/3)pi(d/2)^3

NV Number Density = (ppm/10^6)*(Avogadro's Number*diamond density)/molar mass

NVs/ND = NV Number Density * Volume 

Mass per ND = diamond density * volume

Molar Concentration = dispersion/((mass/ND)*Avogadro's Number)
